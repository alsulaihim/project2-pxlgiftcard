# Notification Sound File
This is a placeholder for the notification sound file.
You should replace this with an actual MP3 audio file for the notification sound.
You can use a short, pleasant notification sound (usually 1-2 seconds).
Common options include:
- A simple bell sound
- A soft chime
- A gentle pop sound
- A subtle ding

To add a real sound file:
1. Find or create a short MP3 notification sound
2. Replace this file with the actual MP3 file
3. Keep the filename as "notification.mp3"
