# Giftcard + PXL Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Create a mobile-first electronic giftcard marketplace that rewards user loyalty through tier advancement
• Implement PXL currency system offering price appreciation and tier-based savings (up to 13% discount + 3% cashback)
• Build a 5-tier progression system (Starter → Rising → Pro → Pixlbeast → Pixlionaire) with visual status recognition
• Achieve 10,000 registered users and $1M+ giftcard sales within first year
• Drive 70%+ transaction adoption of PXL currency over traditional USD payments
• Establish comprehensive chat system with tier-based channels and community engagement features
• Maintain 60%+ monthly active user retention through gamification and financial incentives

### Background Context

The traditional giftcard market offers static pricing with no loyalty incentives, creating a significant opportunity for disruption. Users currently pay full retail price with no rewards for frequent purchases or larger platform balances, while lacking engagement features that would drive long-term platform loyalty.

This PRD addresses the market gap by combining giftcard sales with a proprietary currency (PXL) that appreciates over time, creating both utility and investment potential. The solution targets digital-savvy consumers aged 25-45 who regularly purchase giftcards and are motivated by savings opportunities, status recognition, and gamified experiences. The platform's mobile-first approach captures the majority user base effectively while providing a sophisticated dual-currency marketplace with dynamic exchange rates and tier-based benefits.

### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Define Technology Stack**: Work with technical architect to select specific languages, frameworks, and databases
2. **Supplier Integration Research**: Identify major giftcard suppliers and their API capabilities
3. **PXL Algorithm Specification**: Define exchange rate calculation variables and update frequency

**Quality Improvements:**
1. Expand technical assumptions section with specific technology preferences
2. Add supplier partnership requirements to functional requirements
3. Define chat system architecture approach (custom WebSocket vs third-party service)

# PRD Addendum — PXL Purchase Discount

## Functional Requirements — Add
- **FR-PXL-BUY-DISCOUNT:** On USD→PXL conversions, the platform applies a **tier-based purchase discount** as **bonus PXL** (USD paid does not decrease). Discount schedule by tier: Starter 0%, Rising 3%, Pro 7%, Pixlbeast 9%, Pixlionaire 13%. Discounts apply only to USD→PXL conversions and follow existing risk/fraud limits.

## Epic 2: PXL Currency & Tier System — Story 2.1 (Acceptance Criteria) — Add
- Conversion engine credits **basePxl + bonusPxl**, where `basePxl = floor(usdAmount × exchangeRate)` and `bonusPxl = floor(basePxl × d)` for tier discount `d`. Record `appliedDiscount`, `bonusPxl`, and `effectiveRate = (basePxl + bonusPxl)/usdAmount` in the transaction log.


## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Please review this PRD and initiate UX architecture design mode, focusing on the dark theme Vercel-inspired design system, mobile-first responsive layouts, and tier-based visual hierarchy for the 5-tier progression system.

### Architect Prompt
Please review this PRD and initiate technical architecture design mode, focusing on the monorepo structure, real-time WebSocket requirements, PXL currency engine, dual payment processing, and comprehensive chat system architecture.
