## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Motion:** Every animation serves a functional purpose - providing feedback, guiding attention, or communicating state changes. No decorative animations that don't enhance usability.

**Performance First:** All animations maintain 60fps on mobile devices, with fallback to reduced motion for accessibility and performance constraints.

**Tier Celebration:** Special emphasis on tier progression animations to reinforce gamification and achievement.

### Key Animations

- **Tier Progression Ring:** Animated fill with bounce easing when user advances (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: spring(1, 80, 10))

- **PXL Balance Counter:** Number countup animation for balance updates (Duration: 800ms, Easing: ease-out)

- **Currency Conversion:** Smooth transition between USD/PXL pricing views (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))

- **Giftcard Purchase Success:** Scale and fade celebration with tier benefit highlight (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-out)

- **Chat Message Send:** Slide-in animation with typing indicator fade (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)

- **Page Transitions:** Slide transitions between main sections (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94))

- **Loading States:** Skeleton loading with shimmer effect (Duration: 1500ms loop, Easing: linear)

- **Tier Badge Pulse:** Subtle pulse animation for new tier achievements (Duration: 2000ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

- **Error State Shake:** Gentle shake for form validation errors (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-out)

- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Elastic pull animation with PXL rate refresh (Duration: variable, Easing: spring physics)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, Largest Contentful Paint < 2.0s on 3G mobile connections
- **Interaction Response:** Touch interactions respond within 100ms, complex operations (tier calculations) complete within 500ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations, graceful degradation to 30fps on older devices

### Design Strategies

**Image Optimization:**
- WebP format for all giftcard images with JPEG fallbacks
- Responsive image sizing with srcset for different device densities
- Lazy loading for marketplace catalog with intersection observer
- Brand logo sprite sheets to reduce HTTP requests

**Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:**
- Route-based code splitting for each main section (Dashboard, Marketplace, Wallet, Chat, Profile)
- Component-level lazy loading for heavy features (charts, file upload, admin panels)
- Progressive loading of tier-based features based on user status

**Real-time Performance:**
- WebSocket connection optimization with reconnection logic
- Debounced PXL rate updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- Chat message pagination to limit DOM size
- Virtual scrolling for transaction history and large lists

**Mobile-First Optimization:**
- Critical CSS inlined for above-the-fold content
- Progressive enhancement for non-essential features
- Touch gesture optimization with passive event listeners
- Battery-conscious background sync strategies

**Caching Strategy:**
- Service worker for offline giftcard browsing
- Aggressive caching of static assets (icons, logos, brand images)
- Smart cache invalidation for dynamic content (PXL rates, user balances)
- Local storage optimization for user preferences and tier status

**Bundle Size Management:**
- Tree shaking for unused component library features
- Dynamic imports for admin-only functionality
- Shared chunk optimization for common dependencies
- Minimal polyfill loading based on browser support
