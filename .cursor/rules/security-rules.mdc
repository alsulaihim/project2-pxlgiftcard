# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Giftcard + PXL Platform, please report it to us immediately. We take all security reports seriously and will respond promptly.

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

Email: security@[your-domain].com  
Response Time: Within 24 hours  
Resolution Target: Critical - 48 hours, High - 7 days, Medium - 30 days

## Security Standards & Compliance

### PCI DSS Compliance
- All payment card data handling follows PCI DSS standards
- Card details are never stored in our database
- Payment processing handled by certified providers (Stripe, PayPal)
- Regular security audits scheduled quarterly

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Key Management**: Firebase managed encryption keys with automatic rotation
- **Database Security**: Firestore security rules enforce data isolation

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Social login providers (Google, Apple, Facebook) with OAuth 2.0
- Email/password with strong password requirements
- Phone number verification via SMS OTP
- Session management with JWT tokens (15-minute access, 7-day refresh)

#### Authorization Levels
```typescript
enum UserRoles {
  USER = 'user',           // Standard platform user
  VERIFIED = 'verified',   // KYC verified user
  MODERATOR = 'moderator', // Chat moderation privileges  
  ADMIN = 'admin',         // Full platform administration
  SUPER_ADMIN = 'super_admin' // System-level access
}
```

### API Security

#### Rate Limiting
```typescript
const rateLimits = {
  anonymous: '10 requests per minute',
  authenticated: '100 requests per minute',
  premium: '1000 requests per minute',
  
  // Sensitive endpoints
  login: '5 attempts per 15 minutes',
  passwordReset: '3 requests per hour',
  pxlTransfer: '30 transactions per hour'
};
```

#### API Authentication
- Firebase Auth tokens required for all authenticated endpoints
- Token validation on every request
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- IP-based rate limiting and DDoS protection

### Financial Security

#### PXL Currency Protection
- One-way conversion only (USD â†’ PXL)
- Transaction signing with user confirmation
- Daily transfer limits based on tier
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Automated fraud detection patterns

#### Transaction Limits
```typescript
const transactionLimits = {
  starter: {
    daily: 1000,      // $1,000 USD equivalent
    perTransaction: 500
  },
  rising: {
    daily: 5000,
    perTransaction: 2000
  },
  pro: {
    daily: 10000,
    perTransaction: 5000
  },
  pixlbeast: {
    daily: 25000,
    perTransaction: 10000
  },
  pixlionaire: {
    daily: 100000,
    perTransaction: 50000
  }
};
```

### KYC & AML Compliance

#### Identity Verification
- Government-issued ID verification
- Address proof documentation
- Facial recognition matching
- Sanctions list checking
- PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) screening

#### Transaction Monitoring
- Real-time transaction analysis
- Unusual pattern detection
- Geographic anomaly alerts
- Velocity checking
- Manual review triggers for high-risk transactions

### Chat Security (Rocket.Chat)

#### Message Security
- End-to-end encryption for direct messages (optional)
- Message retention policies (90 days default)
- Content moderation with automated filtering
- User reporting system with admin review

#### Access Control
- SSO integration with platform authentication
- Tier-based channel access
- Automatic de-provisioning on account suspension
- Audit logging for all administrative actions

### Infrastructure Security

#### Cloud Security (Firebase/Vercel)
- SOC 2 Type II compliant infrastructure
- ISO 27001 certified data centers
- Automatic security patches
- DDoS protection at edge
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules

#### Backup & Recovery
- Automated daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery (up to 30 days)
- Geo-redundant backup storage
- Tested recovery procedures (monthly)
- RPO: 1 hour, RTO: 4 hours

### Security Headers

```typescript
const securityHeaders = {
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://apis.google.com https://www.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://*.firebaseio.com wss://*.firebaseio.com https://*.rocket.chat",
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()'
};
```

### Vulnerability Management

#### Dependency Scanning
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Weekly vulnerability scans
- Critical patches within 24 hours
- npm audit on every build

#### Code Security
- Static code analysis with ESLint security plugins
- Secret scanning prevention
- Code review requirements for security-sensitive changes
- Penetration testing (annually)

### Incident Response Plan

#### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Data breach, payment system compromise
- **High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, XSS vulnerabilities
- **Low**: Minor security improvements

#### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring or user report
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove vulnerability
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review
